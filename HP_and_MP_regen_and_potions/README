Health and Mana manager meant to use regeneration when outside of combat (or if the targets attack is significantly lower).
Uses positions when in combat and target damage could out DPS the regen skills.

COMPLETED:
[X] Check HP, MP ratios
[X] Use potions and Skills
[X] Custom use potion script
[X] Alerts user in game log if low on potions

TO-DO HIGH PRIORITY:
-

TO-DO LOW PRIORITY:
- 

CANCELLED:
- Gather the amount of damage a monster target can deal 
    Why: Seemed irrelevant. If something does enough damage to get health below threshhold, a potion should be used regardless of the monsters ATK.


EXAMPLE TO USE
check_hp_and_mp("true", "hp", 0.85, 0.2. 3);
parameters: debug, focus, hp_thresh, mp_thresh, ratio

 debug: true = print messages to game log. false = do not print messages to game log.
 focus: "hp" = healing is prioritized. "mp" = mana is prioritized. "both" equal priority
         NOTE: "both" ignores ratio
 hp_thresh exmple: with a 1000 max hp, 0.85 = 850 hp left before using a healing potion.
 mp_thresh example: with 100 max mp, 0.2 = 200 mp remaining before using a mana potion.

 ratio: used to determine how many regens to use before using secondary regen.
