EXAMPLE TO USE
check_hp_and_mp("true", "hp", 0.85, 0.2. 3);
parameters: debug, focus, hp_thresh, mp_thresh, ratio

 debug: true = print messages to game log. false = do not print messages to game log.
 focus: "hp" = healing is prioritized. "mp" = mana is prioritized. "both" equal priority
         NOTE: "both" ignores ratio
 hp_thresh exmple: with a 1000 max hp, 0.85 = 850 hp left before using a healing potion.
 mp_thresh example: with 100 max mp, 0.2 = 200 mp remaining before using a mana potion.
