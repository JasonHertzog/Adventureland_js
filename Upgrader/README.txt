Brainstorming
==============
set level goals per upgrade.
    example: I want a level 7 "Wanderer's Gloves" item.
Track the cost to upgrade the weapon.
    example: add cost of each upgrade scroll per level.
Script can stop if over a budget (Don't exceed spending X amount.)
    example: spending over max gold for budget will cause program to surrender.
